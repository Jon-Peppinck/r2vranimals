<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function creates an object that represents an A-Frame scene. A scene is
a special type of A-Frame entity that is the root entity of the WebVR scene.
Like regular entities it can have components added to it that change its
behaviour.
</p>
<p>A scene has a html representation that is based off a template supplied in
the 'template' argument. The template is a partially filled out A-Frame html
that contains some Javascript js_sources, and potentially some convenient
entities. Included templates are:
* 'basic' Scene which is empty but for a 10m x 10m grid for ground.
Default lights are injected by A-Frame.
* 'basic_map' As per basic but camera position starts higher, and WASD
movement controls are added. A bright light is situated high in the sky.
* 'empty' an empty scene. Default lights are injected by A-Frame.
The built-in templates are intended for debugging/construction purposes. Use
'empty' for real scenes or build your own template.
</p>
<p>A scene can render itself and all its child entities and assets to a single
html file that defines a WebVR scene that can be viewed in a browser. In
addition to this a scene can also be called upon to serve itself so that it
can be viewed immediately.
</p>
<p>Scene components are expressed as ... arguments passed to this function.
</p>
<p>Child entities are passed as list in the 'children' argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An R6 object representing an A-Frame scene.
