<h2>a_asset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create an A-Frame asset
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
a_asset(id = "", src, .parts = NULL, .tag = "a-asset-item",
  .inline = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>id</code></td>
<td>
<p>an an id to be used by the asset item in the asset block. #id will
be used to refernce the asset in component configuratuion.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>src</code></td>
<td>
<p>the location of the asset</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.parts</code></td>
<td>
<p>the location(s) of files referred to in the 'src' file that
need to be served with it. Examples are '.bin' files that accompany glTF
models or texture images that accompany '.mtl' files. These are referred
to in 'src' by relative paths, so must reside at or below the same
directory as 'src'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.tag</code></td>
<td>
<p>the tag text to use in the asset block. Defaults to
'a-asset-item'. Another common choices is &quot;img&quot; for images.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.inline</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean signifying if the asset is to be specified inline with the entity. If true, the containing A-Frame scene does not wait for the asset to load.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is used to create an asset that will be loaded before an
A-Frame scene loads in the browser. Assets are typically models, images,
videos, and audio files. The asset object understands there may be two
references to the asset: one in the &lt;a-assets&gt; block and the second refernce
in a component configuratuion. It knows how to render itself for both of
these differnt contexts. It can also be called with 'inline=TRUE' which has
the effect of omitting it from the &lt;a-assets&gt; block and inserting a direct
link into the component configuration.
</p>
<p>Assets in the &lt;a-assets&gt; block are loaded before the scene is rendered. This
can delay the scene at a blank white page while they are fetched. Assets
defined inline do not delay scene rendering.
</p>
<p>Assets can be located on local disk, or at remote URLs. The asset
declaration will examine the 'src' parameter to see if it conforms to known
URL conventions. If so r2vr will not attempt to serve the asset, but it will
generate the required references to is in the output scene.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an asset object.
